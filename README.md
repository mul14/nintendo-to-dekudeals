# Simple Shortcut from Nintendo Store to DekuDeals.com

I need to check the lowest price games on Nintendo Switch.
That's the reason I've made this.
I Hope it can also help someone.

## How to install?

1. Download https://github.com/mul14/nintendo-to-dekudeals/archive/master.zip and unzip.

2. Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) or open Settings then choose Extensions.

3. Enable "Developer mode".

4. Click "Load unpacked", and choose the folder that you already unzipped.

5. Visit Nintendo Store (e.g https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dead-cells-switch/), and you will see "View on DekuDeals.com" below the game title.
